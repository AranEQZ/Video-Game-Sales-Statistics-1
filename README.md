# VG Sales Descriptive Statistics

By: Aran Ezzaldeen - Raman Bahadin - Shad Omed - Dyako Sardar

This project replicates the structure and methodology of the *Cardio Good Fitness Descriptive Statistics* notebook, as part of a university statistics assignment. Instead of analyzing fitness data, we use the **Video Game Sales dataset (vgsales.csv)** to explore statistical patterns, visualizations, and correlations among sales figures and related attributes.

## 📊 Project Overview

The main goal of this notebook is to perform **descriptive statistical analysis** using Python, including:

- Dataset overview and structure
- Summary statistics
- Handling missing values
- Value counts and unique entries
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical analysis
- Correlation heatmaps

## 📁 Dataset

- **File Name:** `vgsales.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle / University of Sulaimani Statistics course materials
- **Contains:** Global and regional sales data for video games across multiple platforms and genres.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
